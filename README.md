# Mask Off
Project for Cutie Hack 2020

Mask Off is a COVID-19 heat map tracker that allows users to to input:
* Their location
* The number of individuals they've seen with or without masks
* If there was sufficient social distancing present in the area
## Credits
A massive thank you to Jared Tanuwidjaja, AJ Villamor, and Samuel Valls for participating with me, and helping me build an app in what limited constraints we had.

Bootstrap CSS and JS belong to Bootstrap, and are only dependencies for the code to run.
